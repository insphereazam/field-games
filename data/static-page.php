      <h4>Get Involved in Conservation</h4>
      <hr>

      <p>FGA was established in 1958 by hunters in Victoria who were extremely concerned with the amount of wetland and other natural habitat being destroyed by agricultural, industrial and residential activities. More than 50 years on, FGA is still a leading force in wetland conservation in Australia.</p>
      <p>Every FGA Branch undertakes conservation projects in and around their home base, and every member of FGA supports conservation activities individually or through their Branch.</p>
      <p>However, you donâ€™t have to be a member to support wetland restoration projects undertaken by FGA. The Wetlands Environmental Taskforce (Public Fund), or WET as it is more commonly known, is a registered environmental charity established by FGA to provide everyone with a way to support real and innovative wetland projects. It also partners with other organisations to achieve outcomes for all members of our communities.</p>
